# there is no more 32 Bit version :(
# FUZE-BASIC-download
the exe file for FUZE-BASIC

Just download the .EXE file
Then open it and install
Finaly just try to locate where it is ¯\_(*_*)_/¯

There is a Linux version...
but I cant find it :(
Same thing for Apple computers

But luckly we have wine and other Emulators
I cant think of any for Apple computers right
now but i am sure there are some hopefuly

Also if there are any isues dont come 
complaining to me I am just the one who
found this and put it on Github

And this was a pain to find there are literaly only
6 or so videos on this and Fuze literaly deleted the website 
that had the download link on it and there was barly any documentaton
on this only PDF's
so I had to go to the internet arcives and scower
thoes videos and PDF's to find the link to the old website that
had it and then find out how to use it and stuff

Here is the link https://web.archive.org/web/20170622054710/https://www.fuze.co.uk/download-fuze.html
or https://www.fuze.co.uk/download-fuze.html but this one is deleted

also please star this so more people are more likely to se this
